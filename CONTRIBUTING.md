## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section explains how to submit a bug report.

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section explains how to suggest an enhancement.

- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- If you don't find an existing issue, [open a new one](https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name/issues/new).
- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed enhancement.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the Calendar App? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:
- [Good first issues](https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain project quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Calendar App

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing.
